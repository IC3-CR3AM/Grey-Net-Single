		<string>Hello,

I have high expectations of you, your computer skills are much higher than
Normal, so I guess you can get at least 2 levels.

Your first goal is to get a port scanning tool. I know
You can find such a tool on a computer. You need to enter
Invasion of the system can obtain this tool.

The file name of the tool is: PortScannerW32.exe
It should be in a folder called Tools.

Here are some of the data you need for this task:
His IP address: 192.168.1.1
Open port : 8080
Username : admin
Password : admin

First Ping his IP address to see if he is online.
Then use his IP and port to remotely log into his computer.
Steal to file and leave quickly!

!! Attention !!
Do not forget to delete the log file in the TelnetLogs folder.
What you should delete is: 176.158.255.1

Good luck. If you succeed, I will send you an email again.</string>
