		<string>Hello,

I have high expectations of you, your computer skills are much higher than
Normal, so I guess you can get at least 2 levels.

Your first goal is to get a port scanning tool. I know
You can find such a tool on a computer. You need to enter
Invasion of the system can obtain this tool.

The file name of the tool is: portScanner
It should be in a folder called HackTools.

Here are some of the data you need for this task:
His IP address: 192.168.1.100
Open port : 23
Username : admin
Password : admin

First Ping his IP address to see if he is online.
Then use his IP and port to remotely log into his computer.
Steal to file and leave quickly!

!! Attention !!
Do not forget to delete the log file in the folder.
What you should remove is: 192.168.1.1

Good luck. If you succeed, I will send you an email again.</string>

		<string>Good job,

Well, you got the portScanner.

The next tool you need is fileDestroy.

I know there is only one place where you can get it. Abandonned text
Servers, that&apos;s where I used to work. This is the person who remembers
Some of the data:

IP address : 192.168.1.101
Port : 500
Username : admin
Password : nimda

The file you need to download is destroyFile
But I don&apos;t know what folder it is in. You must find it.
But there are programs to track you, not to be caught!

After you download it, you can install it like portscanner
Install it. It is automatically added to your hacking toolbar.

Don&apos;t forget your delete log! ! ! Good luck.
If you succeed, I will contact you again.</string>

		<string>Well done!

It seems that your proficiency is very suitable for me to do real hacking
jobs.

A stupid person stole a document from someone else.
I don&apos;t want to know the details, I just need you to delete it.

The file I want to delete is FBI_snatchlist.doc, which is
Save it somewhere on your hard drive, find it, and delete it.

And when you&apos;re there, you&apos;d better destroy his Windows
System, remove win.com from windows folder&gt;:)

Here is the data you need:
IP address : 221.255.1.1
Port : Unknown
Username : user
Password : anonymity

If you succeed, I will advertise your name, so
In the future, if strangers contact you for hacking work, please do not
Be surprised.</string>

		<string>I learned something about you from my friends.
I really need your help now.

A few minutes ago a group of idiots attacked my server with a lot of DRDoS.
Fortunately I was very smart redirected to 127.0.0.1. My server is
It survived the attack, but it did not end.

This is their main IP address 101.133.1.25

Let me see if you can send their DRDoS project (plan)
give me. And destroy it after you steal it so they donâ€™t
Can hurt us again.

I get the login data for you:
Username is random
The password may be random

Now it&apos;s as if I&apos;ve proven what a real hack is!</string>
