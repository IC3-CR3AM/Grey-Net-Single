Mission
-------

You recieve you assignments by email. Read them carefully, they for example contain the IP address of the machine you must hack. I'm not going to explain how you should go about the rest, because that would take the fun out of the game. But it's all quit self-explaining.


Just remember these things:

- After you succesfully connect to the target host using SSH, the target system will start to backtrace you. Don't let them completely trace you because this will lead to your arrest. You can view the trace process in the left lower corner during SSH sessions.

  If you don't think you are going to complete the mission before the trace completes, quickly disconnect and reconnect to try it again.

- VERY IMPORTANT: always delete your logfile before you disconnect from a SSH session. The logfiles are not always on the same place, because every system is different. But it's usually in a folder called "Logs". Find your logfile (192.168.010.001) and DESTROY (see Toolbox) it.

- If you get busted 3 times the game is over. The judge doesn't like a persistant hacker.

The toolbar
-----------

In the game you have various tools at your disposal. Some tools you will have to steal from remote systems first.


Button     Function
------     --------
   
Inbox    : This is your email inbox. This is where you recieve new assignments. Read these emails well, they contain lots of information you might need during a mission

Ping     : After you've read the mail, you will need to confirm if your target is online. You do this by using the Ping button. Enter the target IP address and ping it. Your computer will try to to contact the remote computer, and will tell you if it's online

Portscan : With portscan you can scan a verified IP address for open exploitable ports. Press the Portscan button and enter the target IP address, along with the scanning range. The range must be between 2000 and 4000 (usually it's best to enter these values)

SSH      : When you know the target IP address AND an exploitable open port, you can use SSH to connect to the target system

flag : When you know this code in the system,  you can pass this level.


Console commands
----------------

PING <ip address>
   For example: ping 127.0.0.1

   A ping sends packages to a remote host. If it's online, it will respond. This  way you can find out if your target is online


SSH <ip address> <port>
   For example: SSH 127.0.0.1 21

   This let's you connect to a remote host on an open port. After you bypass the login system, you can browse the target system


DIR (or LS)
   This lists all the files of the remote computer. An example of the output is:

   Command.com
   Io.sys
   Windows <DIR>
   Logs <DIR>

   Where "Command.com" and "Io.sys" are files, and "Windows" and "Logs" are folders


CD <foldername>
   For example: cd Windows

   This changes the folder you are viewing. After giving this command you can use the DIR command to see what files are in the folder

   To go back to the document root use on of these commands:
   CD ..
   CD \
   CD..
   CD\

Installing tools from the commandline
-------------------------------------

After you download a tool with the download command from a remote computer and go offline, you can install the tool on your own local system. Just navigate to the downloads folder and enter the name of the tool.

Example:
cd ..
cd downloads
PortscannerW32.exe

*press enter after each command
